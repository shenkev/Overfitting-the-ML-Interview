# Overfitting the ML Interview Progress
I've uploaded a rough version of the book. Overall I'm not completely satisfied with the writing yet. There are some sections that can be clarified (e.g. regression trees). I plan on improving the book in the coming months. The diagrams are there as placeholders, I'll need to find help making more professional looking diagrams. I'll also need to find some help to generate thoughful and useful interview questions and answers (then test them).
